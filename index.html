   <p><strong><del> This is Something New </del></strong> <mark>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text</mark> <s>of the printing</s> and typesetting industry. 
    <b>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's</b> standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
    <em>when an unknown printer took a galley</em> of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
    <i>It has survived not only five centuries,</i> but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
    remaining essentially unchanged. 
    <u>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset</u> sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
     including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>
